# Vidly

Vidly is an Express (Nodejs framework) demo project that I practiced to learn.
On the root directory of this repository, you can find **Vidly.postman_collection.json** file
to import the API endpoints to your Postman for testing.
Please feel free to suggest me any good and useful points cause I'm new in backend development.

## Which libraries I used in this project?
- express (nodejs framework)
- nodemon
- winston (for logging)
-  bcrypt  (hashing password)
-  helmet  
-  joi (validating inputs came from client)
- mongoose (working with mongodb in an easier way)
